## Exercise for the begginners
The student should read the following blogs:
- [7 secrets...](https://www.codementor.io/codementorteam/7-secrets-to-staying-motivated-when-learning-to-code-a2dy7hqar) 
- [To motivate myself...](https://www.quora.com/What-can-I-do-to-motivate-myself-for-programming-regularly-for-4-6-hours)

Now you can discuss with your classmates :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.


Remember professor is not a :cop:, professor is a advisor who wants to discover different things about 
programming.

## Homework (Section is building, the final version will be ready the monday at 9:00am)

Hi guys! In this part all of you will find the first homework. 

To start you have to read the next papers:
- Read the abstract and Introduction of this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.1719.pdf) (Identifying change patterns in software history)
- Read [The golden age of software architecture](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1605176/)
- Read the parts 1 and 2 of the [The History of Software Architecture - In the Eye of the Practitioner](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04055.pdf)

Now you have to write a report (nice document!) about the importance and the impact of the software in the actual world. 
Print and bring the document next August 15th (wednesday) to discuss in the class. :+1:
